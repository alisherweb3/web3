# Rust Fundamentals

Rust is a strong and static programming language.

```Rust
let distance:f64 = Earth_Radius_In_Kilometers * central_angle;
```

```Rust
println("{:.1}", distance);
```
What is Rust? Why should I care about?

Rust is a language that is based around safety and speed. Rust programs typically run ass fast as or faster than C++ programs. Writing concurent is trivial!

Why learn Rust?

Rust memory managment is handled by Rust without the need for a garbage collector. If your code compiles, it will run without error. Native cross-platform executables. helps enforce consistency which supports governance and makes onboarding easier. Allows mentoring of developers to focus on areas other than defensive coding.


What's the Catch?

Rust has a steep learning curve. You must approach Rust programming differently.

Final Thoughts:

Rust has been the most loved language for the last several years. It's a good time to learn Rust, because big companies are investing in Rust's future.
